== MOTIVATION
This library should ease the use of CSS3 animations.
For flexible use in games or simpler eye-catchers this file consists as a jQuery library. You will need to include jQuery 1.6, 1.7 or later

These animations are supported by latest Safari/Chrome/FF versions.
Also this will (hopefully) availible in future Opera release and IE10.


== API

These functions apply to jQuery Objects:

//generate (and start) animation
.animation('animate', {
                name: 'MyCoolAnimation',
                duration         : '1s',
                from        : { cssFormatter : cssValue },
                to         : { cssFormatter : cssValue },
                infinite         : false,
                playState : 'running',
                timingFunc: 'linear'
           });    

//Pause Animation
.animation('pause');

//Start animation (probably from lastly paused state)
.animation('start');

//Remove Animation
.animation('destroy');

== EXAMPLES

$('#ufo').animation('animate', {
                 duration: '1s',
                 from: {'transform':'translate(0px)'},
                 to: {'transform':'translate(2342px)'},
                 infinite:false
           });
